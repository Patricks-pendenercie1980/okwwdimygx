Man, okay, so I just walked outta the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Deva and, like, I’m scribbling thoughts while my head's still spinning. It’s like, I’m sitting here on this uncomfortable wooden bench, this one plank jabbing into my lower back — a bit like the plot twists of the   jabbed at my brain, just unexpected and kinda relentless, you know?

Popcorn crumbs everywhere. My lap looks like a tiny, salty battlefield. But, jeez, this  , it’s like this bizarre kaleidoscope of myth and high-tech weirdness. One minute you're in this silent, echoing temple of memories, and the next, it's just loud, blaring chaos with neon blues that felt like they were melting into my eyeballs. God, why is cinema popcorn always so sticky??

> Oh, and the whole theater was alive, like, buzzing with crumpled bags and whispered debates during the credits. It's like being in a beehive, echoing all the thoughts that were stinging at my own brain. Should probably just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , might catch things I missed on screen while someone was shuffling past with their three-gallon soda.

There was this one scene, though, with Deva standing all regal-like atop this mountain—if a Mountain Dew commercial went psychedelic in the ‘80s and then got art-directed by a hyperactive intern—and then, whoosh! A flock of holographic doves. It all felt as ridiculous as comparing jet skis to philosophical debates, but somehow it worked? Maybe?

Eh, it's like trying to pull a narrative from a bowl of spaghetti while someone's screaming about their lost left shoe. Halfway through, my mind sort of wandered to, like, is it really possible to mind-meld with a forest? Are we all just trees in disguise? Probably need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, just to untangle this noodle nonsense.

Somebody asked me to remind them to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , but I swear my brain’s just... boink... mush right now.

Anyway, here's what happens when you click away at your keyboard mindlessly:

```c
int main() {
   printf(Mind garbled
);
   escape(bubblewrap);
   return dreams_don't_code(42);
}
```

Okay, done. Gotta get up. Seriously, these benches were designed by villains.
